# nodeServerBoilerPlate

## A barebones repo that can quickly serve up a Node server with Express.

## Simply run 'node server.js' to run the server.

## Middleware.js --> Defines your app (where to find static files, what middleware to include)

Middleware.js also establishes some generic routes you are more than free to modify to your liking.
